# GHS ROVER PROJECT

I am working in a group to create a Rover that is able to detect whether or not there is enough moisture within the soil where a plant has been planted. It is made up of three main componants, the acutal rover, robotic arm, and a moisture sensor on the end. They will be running off of Python 2 and will be all programmed onto a Raspberry Pi.
